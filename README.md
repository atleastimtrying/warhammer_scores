# README

This rails app is intended to provide a scoring sheet for people playing warhammer 40k. It's also a chance to me to play with some concepts around work in my spare time!

## Setup

- clone the repo
- `bundle install`
- `rake`

## Tests

This app currently uses minitest and cucumber to run integration and unit tests. these both run using `rake`. they can also be run individually using the standard commands `rails cucumber` and `rails test`.
